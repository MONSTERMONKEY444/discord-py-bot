Sickma's Be Smart.. I assume you have installed Python already, including pip installing discord, asyncio, pyfiglet. Format your Bot Token in the TXT file, 1 token for 1 line. Enable Developer Mode on Discord if you haven't already. Discord Rate Limits the bots as well. I am definitely not responsible for if you nuke a poor Gacha Kid's discord server (if you manage to somehow get the Bot Tokens and the bots have sufficient permission)
